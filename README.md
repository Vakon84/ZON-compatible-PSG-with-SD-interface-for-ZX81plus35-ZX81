# PSG-for-ZX81-35-ZX81-clone
Programmable sound generator for my ZX81 clone, with hardware for SD-card interface

This is a clone of the ZON soundgenerator for my ZX81 clone ZX81+35 which you can find on github as ZX81plus35.

This should work on a real ZX81, if you build an adapter between the (female) edge header connector, and an edge connector for the ZX81.

This PCB was designed but was never tested, as I went on to design a color homecomputer (RhoCoCo) and abandoned my ZX81+35 efforts, see the ZX81plus35 page.

this A-Y-3-8912 PSG based programmable sound generator should be software compatible with ZON based software (dancing demon and others)

I used the GPIO's of the 8912 to interface an SD-Card interface, with a bit-banged sd-card driver you should be able to read SD-cards.
